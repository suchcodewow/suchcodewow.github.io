## Step 4

Add Dynatrace!

### Need help choosing?

**Dynatrace via Helm** is a great way to build off of your rancher orcheatrator to install Dynatrace from the UI.  It uses a Helm chart and is a straight forward way to set it up.

**Dyantrace via kubernetes** takes us back to the command line to install Dynatrace Operator directly through kubectl.  It takes a few more steps but provides some additional options & some additional background on kubernetes.

You can't go wrong either way!  Both end up working the same way in the end.
