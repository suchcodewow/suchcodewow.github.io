## Step 1

Get your server ready!

## Need help choosing?

**Multipass** is a flexible, quick, easy option if you have a modern PC.  The biggest advantage is that you don't need anything else.  But keep in mind: your computer obviously must run for kubernetes to run & this isn't the best solution if you want to access it from outside your computer.

You can **bring your own host** if you already have a server and can carve out some space to build your bowl.

**Cloud Hosting** is best if you already have a cloud subscription where you can build your own servers.
