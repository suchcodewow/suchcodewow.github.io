### Need help choosing?

**Multipass** is a flexible, quick, easy option if you have a modern PC.

You can **bring your own host** if you already have a lab setup and just want to carve out some space on a server to build a bowl.

**Cloud Hosting** is best if you already have a cloud subscription or if you have available credit with one.
