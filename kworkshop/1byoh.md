### Ensure your host meets these prerequisites

Hey!  You have your own server.  Cool!  To work with all of steps in building your bowl, please make sure it meets the following criteria:

- It's running a modern Linux kernel.
- It has sufficient resources (recommended 4+ cores and 4GB+ memory).
- It has at least 16GB of free space.
- It can reliably connect to the internet.

If you don't meet these prequisites, you could try either [Multipass](./1multipass) if your PC is fairly new- or try the [cloud hosted](./1cloud) option.

### Choose your next ingredient
