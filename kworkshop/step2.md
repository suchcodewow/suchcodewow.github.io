## Step 2
Install Kubernetes!

### Need help choosing?

For this lab, any of the following options work great.  You can't go wrong!

**K3s** is a light Kubernetes version developed by Rancher (the team that built the orchestrator we'll install later).  It's a production grade system but trades some less-used functionality for it's lightweight stance.

**MiniKube** is a simple solution used frequently for learning and testing.  For production, it can be limited.  It works fine for this lab- but in real world scenarios you might find it used much less.

**MicroK8s** is a minimal production Kubernetes distribution based on the canonical distribution from the ubuntu team.
