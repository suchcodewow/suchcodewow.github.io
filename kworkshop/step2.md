### Need help choosing?

For this lab, any of the following options work great.  You can't go wrong!

**K3s** is a light Kubernetes version developed by Rancher (the team that built the orchestrator we'll install later).  It's a production grade system that's extremely light weight.  The package skips over less-used functions to maintain a small footprint- but these can be added later if needed.

**MicroK8s** is a minimal production Kubernetes distribution based on the canonical distribution from the ubuntu team.
